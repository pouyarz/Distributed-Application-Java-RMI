# Distributed-Application-Java-RMI
Distributed program for adding 2-dimensional matrices using Java RMI, which adds two matrices of size NÃ—N using three computers
(three concurrently run processes). The matrices (A and B) could be filled by randomly generated numbers in the initiating process and then divided to 3 portions and sent to the 3 computers for calculation (one could be the same computer that hosts the initiating process). The final result should be displayed by the initiating process. Also, N could vary and should be read as an input to the system.

# How to Run
Open a command prompt (for server)/n
Compile: javac *.java
Starting RMI: start rmiregistry
Adding Server: java AddServer
Open a command prompt (for client)
Adding Client: java AddClient 127.0.0.1.6
Entr Dimension of Matrix
